## Create a personal copy of Branch's Titanium TestBed app for testing!
  
Branchâ€™s Titanium TestBed app serves as a reference implementation to help you integrate the Branch-Titanium SDK into your app. 

## Titanium TestBed Installation Instructions:

To start using the Titanium TestBed app, please ensure that you have installed and configured Titanium CLI 
(command line interface) from the following location:

- [http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference-section-35619828_TitaniumCommand-LineInterfaceReference-InstallandConfiguretheCLI] ((http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference-section-35619828_TitaniumCommand-LineInterfaceReference-InstallandConfiguretheCLI) 

In addition, please ensure that Titanium CLI knows where your Android and iOS SDKs are located. 

## Clone/Download the Titanium SDK repo:

If you have github installed, then from command line:

1. Navigate to the directory that you would like to download the Branch Titanium TestBed app to.
2. Type in `git clone git@github.com:BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking.git`

This should create a folder called `titanium-branch-deep-linking`. 

Alternatively, you can download/unzip the repository from the location below:

- [https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking)

The TestBed app is located in a directory called `testbed`.

## Build and Run the iOS TestBed App:

To build and run the Branch Titanium TestBed App for iOS, please perform the following steps:

1. Open `tiapp.xml` in your favorite text editor and update it with your Branch Key. Also register a URI scheme for it. 
  
 Detailed instructions on how to perform this step can be found at the following location:
   - [https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking#ios-register-a-uri-scheme-and-add-your-branch-key](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking#ios-register-a-uri-scheme-and-add-your-branch-key)

2. If you are interested in testing Universal Links, then configure Universal Links for the TestBed app using the instructions below: 
   - [https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking#ios-register-a-uri-scheme-and-add-your-branch-key](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking#ios-register-a-uri-scheme-and-add-your-branch-key)   
3. From command line, navigate to `titanium-branch-deep-linking/testbed`.
4. Type `titanium build --platform ios` to build and run the app. 

If the command executes correctly, then the TestBed will load in a iOS simulator.

##Build and run the Android TestBed App:

To build and run the Branch Titanium TestBed App for Android, please perform the following steps:

1. Open `tiapp.xml` in your favorite text editor and update it with your Branch Key. Also register a URI scheme for it. 
   Detailed instructions on how to perform this step can be found at the following location:
   - [https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking#android-register-a-uri-scheme-and-add-your-branch-key](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking#android-register-a-uri-scheme-and-add-your-branch-key)
2. From command line, navigate to: `titanium-branch-deep-linking/testbed`.
3. Type 'titanium build --platform android' to build and run the app.

If the command executes correctly, then the TestBed app will load in a Android emulator.
