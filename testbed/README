## Create a personal copy of Branch's Titanium TestBed app for testing!
  
Branch’s TestBed app for Titanium serves as a reference implementation to help developers integrate the Titanium SDK into their apps. 

## TestBed Installation Instructions:

To start using the Titanium TestBed app, please ensure that you have installed and configured Titanium CLI 
(command line interface) from the following location:

- http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference-section-35619828_TitaniumCommand-LineInterfaceReference-InstallandConfiguretheCLI

In addition, please ensure that Titanium CLI knows where your Android and iOS SDKs are located. 

## Clone/Download the Titanium SDK repo:

If you have github installed, then from command line:

1. Navigate to the directory that you would like to download the Branch Titanium SDK to.
2. Type in `git clone git@github.com:BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking.git`
3. This should create a folder called titanium-branch-deep-linking. 

Alternatively, you can download/unzip the repository from the location below:

- `https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking`

The TestBed app is located in a directory called ‘testbed’.

## Build and run the iOS TestBed App:

To run the TestBed App on iOS please perform the following steps:

1. Open `tiapp.xml` in your favorite text editor and update it to use your Branch Key. Also register a URI scheme. 
   Take a look at our documentation below on how to perform this step:
   - https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking#ios-register-a-uri-scheme-and-add-your-branch-key
2. If you are interested in testing Universal Links then configure Universal Links for the TestBed app as well: 
   - https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking#ios-register-a-uri-scheme-and-add-your-branch-key   
3. From command line, navigate to 'titanium-branch-deep-linking/testbed'.
4. Type 'titanium build --platform ios' to build and run the app. 

If the command executes correctly, then the TestBed will load in a iOS simulator.

##Build and run the Android TestBed App:

To run the TestBed App on Android please perform the following steps:

1. Open tiapp.xml in your favorite text editor and update it to use your Branch Key. Also register a URI scheme. 
   Take a look at our documentation below on how to perform this step:
   - https://github.com/BranchMetrics/titanium-branch-deep-linking#android-register-a-uri-scheme-and-add-your-branch-key
2. From command line, navigate to 'titanium-branch-deep-linking/testbed'.
3. Type 'titanium build --platform android' to build and run the app.

If the command executes correctly, then the TestBed app will load in a Android emulator.
